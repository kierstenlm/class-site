    <strong>The Dogs at Live Oak Beach, Santa Cruz</strong><br>
    <small>Alicia Ostriker</small>
    <ul>
    <li>As if there could be a world<br>
    Of absolute innocence<br>
    In which we forget ourselves<br></li>

    <li>The owners throw sticks<br>
    And half-bald tennis balls<br>
    Toward the surf<br>
    And the happy dogs leap after them<br>
    As if catapulted—<br></li>

    <li>Black dogs, tan dogs,<br>
    Tubes of glorious muscle—<br></li>

    <li>Pursuing pleasure<br>
    More than obedience<br>
    They race, skid to a halt in the wet sand,<br>
    Sometimes they'll plunge straight into<br>
    The foaming breakers<br></li>

    <li>Like diving birds, letting the green turbulence<br>
    Toss them, until they snap and sink<br></li>

    <li>Teeth into floating wood<br>
    Then bound back to their owners<br>
    Shining wet, with passionate speed<br>
    For nothing,<br>
    For absolutely nothing but joy.<br></li></ul>
