        <div class="about">Good Eats, No Meats</div>
        <div class="big"><p>Harrison Street Cafe was established in the year 2000 when good vegetarian food around the VCU area was limited to a couple select eateries. Where could someone go to get a good cup of coffee and some vegetarian and vegan nibbles or cozy up in a booth and get to know a friend or a good book over vegan breakfast? Where could the college student, faculty member, and drummer of XYZ band all fit comfortably in the same space with or without tattoos? Harrison Street Cafe carved out a space for hungry students looking to get a filling meal without breaking the bank and continues to feed vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores all seeking good food, friendly staff, and creative yet humble veg food. As the cafe nears its 20th anniversary, some of the faces have changed but the underlying commitment to good food, reasonable prices, and a variety of treats with a simple coffee and espresso menu remains steady. From our family to yours - come and get some good eats, no meats seven days a week.</p></div>
